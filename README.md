# agenda-unica
Extract data from the Agenda Unica (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bzVASM5_JjCgvNp3Vs0GJ4vDgYsKo_ig5NHU1QI5USc/edit) and convert the agenda in a ontology

The ontology is distributed via a downloadable file, a SPARQL Endpoint and a
_ICalendar_ file (see (http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2445.html)[RDF2455], we found also 
a nice (http://icalendar.org/validator.html)[iCalendar files validator]).
