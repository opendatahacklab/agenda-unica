# Free Agenda

A free agenda is a workflow to populate an events agenda and distribute event data as 
open data.

An agenda in this workflow starts as a google sheet populated via a google form and
then it is converted to an owl ontology.
The ontology is distributed via a downloadable file, a SPARQL Endpoint and a
_ICalendar_ file (see (http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2445.html)[RDF2455], we found also 
a nice (http://icalendar.org/validator.html)[iCalendar files validator]).
